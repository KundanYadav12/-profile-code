          <p> TurnOnSell.com allows any student to sell their books within their college. In the market, some stores buy and sell used books but take a certain margin and impose conditions, such as requiring a store stamp on the books. Not all stores provide the stamp system, leaving students with no option but to sell their books to scrap dealers who buy books on a per kg basis, which doesnâ€™t reflect the true value of the books.
             Many students also want to buy books at half price.TurnOnSell.com offers the best solution to these issues.</p>
